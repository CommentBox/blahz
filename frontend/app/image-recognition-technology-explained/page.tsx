      <h2>What is Image Recognition?</h2>
      <p>
        Image recognition is a field of computer vision that focuses on identifying and detecting features or objects in
        digital images or videos. It involves training AI models to interpret and categorize visual information, much
        like the human brain does.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Components of Image Recognition</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Image Acquisition:</strong> Capturing or inputting the digital image.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pre-processing:</strong> Enhancing the image for better analysis (e.g., noise reduction,
          normalization).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Feature Extraction:</strong> Identifying key features or patterns in the image.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Classification:</strong> Categorizing the image based on its features.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Decision Making:</strong> Determining the final output or action based on the classification.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Machine Learning in Image Recognition</h2>
